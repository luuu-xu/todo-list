# todo-list
The Todo List project from The Odin Project.

Live: https://luuu-xu.github.io/todo-list/

The project is finally finished! 

- The todo list app itself is not way too hard, but I did spend a lot of time sorting out how the dom elements are managed and appended, etc.

- LocalStorage at the beginning seemed super frustrating since JSON only stores data, not methods from objects. But somehow it is solved.

- Possible feature: 
    - separate todo list into two: unchecked and checked, so when a todo is checked, it would be moved down to the checked list.
    - color the todos with their priority, mostly CSS works.
    - add in due date feature...
